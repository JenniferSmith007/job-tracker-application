### Project Summary: 

The goal of this application is to provide an easier way for users to keep track of the numerous applications completed when they are applying to various jobs. This application will take the complexity out of the organization that is crucial to have when juggling multiple stages of interviews and applications from different companies. By having a record of all the information you‚Äôve submitted in the past, Users can easily coordinate the next position to apply to. **Our web application streamlines the ability to reuse and work efficiently when job hunting.** 

We decided on this application because as individuals who have been through the process of finding a new job, we found it hard to keep track of everything we applied to and found this was a **pain point experienced by all our peers.** We thought an application like this one could solve a necessary problem and make the job application process a little less stressful. We hope to utilize this webpage in our own software engineer job endeavors and share with peers for their journeys.
